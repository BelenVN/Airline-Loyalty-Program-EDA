## INTRODUCTION

This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to an airline's customer loyalty program. The main objective is to uncover patterns and trends in flight activity and customer loyalty history, which will help inform strategies for improving customer retention and enhancing overall satisfaction. By analyzing various customer variables, we aim to provide actionable insights that can drive data-driven decision-making in the airline industry.
  
## FILES

Files required for project review:

*    Customer Flight Activity.csv: Contains data on customer flight activity.
*    Customer Loyalty History.csv: provides a detailed profile of customers as well as includes data on the customer loyalty program.
*    airline_data.ipynb: Jupyter notebook including exploratory data analysis (EDA).

#### 1.1. General exploration and cleaning

*   General review and analysis of data using Pandas functions to obtain information about the structure of the data and basic statistics.
*   Initial exploration of the data to identify potential problems (null values, duplicate values, outliers or missing data).
*   DataFrame joining

#### 1.2. Data cleaning

*   Verification of data consistency and correctness.
*   Treatment of null data.

### Second phase visualization

Study of six real-world questions about the data and their representation through graphs.
